% A question from abstract algebra. Here m is an arbitrary binary
% operation (similar to arithmetic multiplication) for 
% which the following three axioms hold.

m(X,i(X)) = e .   % i is an inverse function like one divided by X
m(X,e) = X .      % e is a unit element like 1 when on the right side
m(X,m(Y,Z)) = m(m(X,Y),Z) . % m is an associative operation

% Question: is e also a unit element when it is on the left
% side of multiplication m?
%
% We get the following clause by negating `forall X. m(e,X) = X`
% as `exists X. m(e,X) != X`
% and using an arbitrary unknown constant `c` for existentially 
% quantified `X`.
% In short, if the next clause gives contradiction, then it will
% also give a contradiction for anything you can put in place of `c`.

m(e,c) != c .
